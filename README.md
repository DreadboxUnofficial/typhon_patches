# typhon_patches

these are some patch backups from my [typhon](https://www.dreadbox-fx.com/product/typhon) synthesizer. since the backups are just stored as plain text files under `~/Library/Application\ Support/dreadbox/datesaves`, you should be able to edit the name of the file and the id in the contents to avoid overriding one of yours, copy one of these files in your backup folder, and restore. maybe dreadbox will publish a patch management app at some point.
